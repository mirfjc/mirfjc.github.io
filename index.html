The website hotfunmedia.com was hijacked some time after later 2021. It had been registered for a now defunct social media marketing project. Once hijacked, it was being used in a ransom scam. I very recently regained control of it again.

Authorities have been alerted and an investigation is underway.

I am so sorry for any inconvenience created by this.  Mark.
