The website hotfunmedia.com was registered for a now defunct social media marketing project in mid/late 2021 (it was defunct almost immediately). However, at some point after that it now appears that it - and its associated hosting account - were hijacked, and I was only recently made aware that it was being used in a ransom scam. Thankfully (and with help!) I very recently regained control of it. Authorities have been alerted and an investigation is underway. I am so sorry for any inconvenience created by this. Mark. P.S. When people tell you to use strong passwords, don't joke about it and instead start using them!
